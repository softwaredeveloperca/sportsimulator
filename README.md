Sports Stat Simulator
==============

PHP Sports Stats Game Simulator Framework with module support for any team sport baseball, basketball, hockey, cricket, etc


This is a flexible PHP Sports Stat Simulator Framework that will allow you to draft, create players, run games or entire seasons.


Each sport can be written simply as a module and data elements are flexible.


Have a look at the sample basketball game module for an example of a completed moduled.

Have a look at the sample hockey game module for an example of an empty module.




I will be looking at adding single player type games like tennis or golf shortly.
